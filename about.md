# Better Unlock Progression

A dedicated menu that tracks your progress toward unlockable icons requiring grinding.

This mod helps you stay motivated by showing exactly how close you are to your next unlock, making the grind feel more rewarding. This mod could also help you identify unlocks that you were not aware of before!
